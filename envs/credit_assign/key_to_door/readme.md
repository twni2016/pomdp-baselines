# Key-to-Door Environments
source code: https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/tvt/pycolab

We adapt the environment framework and change some configurations to match the descriptions in the following papers:
- [Synthetic Returns for Long-Term Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12425) with environment name `"KeytoDoor-SR-v0"`
- [Counterfactual Credit Assignment in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09464) with environment name `"KeytoDoor-LowVar-v0"` and `"KeytoDoor-HighVar-v0"`
